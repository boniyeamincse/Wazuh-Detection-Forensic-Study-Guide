# Contributing to Wazuh Detection & Forensic Study Guide 🤝

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this community resource! We welcome contributions from SOC analysts, detection engineers, and security researchers of all levels.

## How Can You Help?

### 1. Adding New Detection Queries
If you have a KQL, Lucene, or DSL query that has successfully detected a real-world threat, we want it!
- Please include the **MITRE ATT&CK Technique ID**.
- Provide a brief description of the detection logic.

### 2. Scenario Walkthroughs
Help expand our **SOC Playbooks** (Module 06) by providing step-by-step investigation steps for new attack types (e.g., Kubernetes attacks, SCADA/ICS, etc.).

### 3. Fixing Typos and Errors
Found a bug in a query or a typo in the documentation? Submit a Quick Fix PR.

## Style Guidelines
- Use **GitHub Flavored Markdown**.
- Wrap all queries in triple backticks with the appropriate language tag (`kql`, `json`, etc.).
- Keep the tone professional but accessible for students.

## Submission Process
1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-query`).
3.  Commit your changes.
4.  Push to your branch and open a Pull Request.
